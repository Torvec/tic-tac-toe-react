# Tic Tac Toe in React + TypeScript + Vite + TailwindCSS
What was initially a vanilla javascript project is now a React + TypeScript + Vite + TailwindCSS project. This project is a combination of my two previous Tic Tac Toe projects but made with React and TypeScript. 

My previous projects:
- [Tic Tac Toe Ultimate](https://github.com/Torvec/tic-tac-toe-ultimate)
- [Tic Tac Toe Classic](https://github.com/Torvec/tic-tac-toe-classic)

## Features
- Play classic Tic Tac Toe on a 3x3 grid or play ultimate Tic Tac Toe on a 9 x 3 x 3 grid.
- Play against a friend (locally)
- Playable with mouse or touch enabled devices.

## Play Now

[Coming Soon](https://github.com/Torvec/tic-tac-toe-react)
