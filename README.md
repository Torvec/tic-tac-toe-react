# Tic Tac Toe in React
![Screenshot of tic tac toe react game modes](./public/tic_tac_toe_react.jpg)
What was initially a vanilla javascript project is now a React + TypeScript + Vite + TailwindCSS project. This project is a combination of my two previous Tic Tac Toe projects but made with React instead of vanilla JavaScript and the canvas element. 

My previous projects:
- [Tic Tac Toe Ultimate](https://github.com/Torvec/tic-tac-toe-ultimate)
- [Tic Tac Toe Classic](https://github.com/Torvec/tic-tac-toe-classic)

## Features
- Play classic Tic Tac Toe on a single 3x3 grid or play Ultimate Tic Tac Toe on nine 3 x 3 grids.
- Play against a friend (locally)
- Playable with mouse or touch enabled devices.
